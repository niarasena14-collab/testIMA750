    <h1>Fall 2025 Reading Reflections</h1>
    <h2><i>In Defense of the Poor Image</i> by Hito Steyerl, 2011</h2>
    <p>I loved this weeks’ reading on the poor image. As someone who has always considered themselves an underdog of sorts, I have always been quite intrigued by things that others may deem or categorize as invaluable or less than (as compared to other things). The idea of cropping, resizing, reformatting, redistributing, re re re, it’s a process of something being done over and over and over again, thus changing the quality of an image. Before this reading I hadn't seen how doing those things disturbs or lessens the quality (this is the very beginning of my coding and technical journey in film and art so they thought processes behind the way I view and approach art is transforming).. But I appreciate how the article made me question if  losing the sharpness of an image (the quality of the image) equates to losing the value of an image? I don’t think it does by any means, I do believe (particularly in my art of creating for wandering self seeking souls) it increases the value of it. The longevity of that image speaks volumes to its importance and value considerably so.  There is also something to be said about anything opaque and hard to make out, silhouettes of people or objects, struggling to make out what you are seeing, playing and pulling focus (as discussed in the article a s being identified as a class position) all such beautiful ways of describing life; Some things are easy to see and understand, others take time to come into view. </p>
    <h3><i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i> by Walter Benjamin</h3>
    <p>What I truly appreciate about the readings is that each week builds upon one another strengthening my understanding of the fundamentals of coding, photoshop, and how the mechanics behind both impact not only the art modes listed, but all art forms. I can honestly say my interest in art never really took me behind the veil of the art. I suppose the history of certain modes and how history and advancement in technology and civilization informed and influenced art.The adaptability of not only the art but the artists in and over time, redefining what that art was, and the accessibility or lack thereof to it. As tie went on, art became something outside of ritual and outside of being in service to that ritual. the ablitty for art tp become more than a religious expression or story telling became more prominent with time and the ability for art to be reporoduced. To be accessible to all. “An analysis of art in the age of mechanical reproduction must do justice to these relationships, for they lead us to an all-important insight: for the first time in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual.” The emancipation of art is such a poetic thing to say, it almost personifies art in a sense.  </p>
    <h3><i>As We May Think</i> by Vannevar Bush</h3>
    <p>This week’s reading was very informative! I must be honest, I never really had the deepest connection to machinery or science and how it relates to or aids in the creation of art. I think coding is really cool and a bit out of my understanding. I think the process of building from scratch is amazing and Bush. My interest (or for lack of a better term, door way) into art has always been more so through emotions and the relaying of those emotions. This class is absolutely redefining what and how I see art, how I can approach it not only from an emotional aspect but a technical one as well. I can’t say that this reading struck me deeply, but I would like to learn to appreciate the ways in which the mechanical, the technical, and the scientific can work in tandem to elevate my art. SECOND READ: I truly did enjoy my time reading this article the second time around. Certain aspects made more sense to me, or i was possibly simply in a better space mentally to fully appreciate the text. It made give thought to inventions and technology that aid in human advancement and necessity and gadgets that are created "because they're cool". The moral obligation we should have when creating and advancing in technology. </p>
    <h3><i>The Society of the Spectacle</i> by Guy Debord</h3>
    <p>This week's reading was great!!!! Although, I find myself frustrated with the cicular annd winding ways in which academia insitsts articles, passages, and matierals of the sort be discussed and written about, I do seem to find joy in finally cracking the code. Much how I felt readinng UNDER COMMONS by Moten annd Harney, Debord speaks in dense language about society and the ways in which illusiion creates falseness wreaking havoc on our interpersonnal relations as well as our idividuality.He diiscusses how we are ruled by consumer goods, rulled  by contennt creationn and appeariinng one way as opposed to really beiing iit. We went from crafttinng art to craftinng our lives in unrealistic surreall ways. He speaks about the ways in  which reality is distorted, erroded, and regergutated back out to us, and how we consume every morsel of it. The idea, or moreso, the reality of being/becoming a passive consumer and I couldn't help but think about how that effects art and the production of it. The demand for art has always been high regardlless the art form, and from previous readings we see how that has impacted the (over) reproduction of images of all kinds; things rarely seem to be one of a kind anymore. The link between commodity, individuality, repliciation, ACCESS (exclusivity) all of which are modes of the spectacle or used within the modes.Social media and Reality tv are BIG examples.</p> 
    <h4><i></i>Constituents of a theory of the media</i> By Hans Magnus Enzensberger </h4>
    <p>This week's reading i found quite interesting. I enjoy readings surrounding society and ethical quandries that surround the shaping of society. I love anything that calls into question our humanity as humans and how we show up in this world. This class has opened me up to analyzing and learning how technology shapes our future and the theories held by others based on the trajectory they believed these inventions would have. Comparing and contrasting their thoughts and opinions to what is being lived today. I have always had a very analytical, and one might say, skeptical feeling towards media. I always felt media was a tool used to muddy waters, confuse, and essentially illicit certain feelinngs or views, but ii enjoy Enzenberger's view more; the beilef that media is in fact its own beast. it's not a tool, iit's an animal with it's own agenda, ot's own tools, and it's own way of being. We are nnot controllingn it, it is controlling us. I love the idea of mobilizing the masses, it's like a call to arms! It's envigorating, and the idea of this being done through the switch from being a passive consumer to being an active one is very similar to the call to arms Guy Debord gave in the society of the spectacle.</p>
    <h4><i>From a Cyborg Manifesto</i> By Donna Haraway</h4>
    <p>Cyborgs, roborts, flying cars! the future of the world? I'm not sure what i expected out of this week's reading, but i found the title exciting (side note, almost signed up for thiis week before i took spectacle of society! but i'm glad i presented on the reading I did!) I defiitely thought going in the reading would be addressing robots, cyborgs and robots and all that, but the fact that a cyborg wasin use as a metaphor was brilliant. The idea of the cyborg being a boundary (i use this term lossely as in the same breath it resembles the breaking/blurring OF said boundaries), blurring the lines between one thing and the the other. This reading was a bit dense for me, so i'm absolutely sure i missed some key elements, but blurring of the relations between animal and human, human and machine, and the physical and nonphysical. </p>
    <h5><i> Electronic Disturbance</i></h5>
    <p>I found this weeks readings to be extremely captivating. Surprisingly so for me, as I tend to get a bit lost in wrapping my head around the technical theory of media and the inventions that make it what it is. Chapters 1 and 2 of The Electronic Disturbance lay out CAE’s core argument that contemporary power has become mobile, diffuse, and deterritorialized, no longer rooted in traditional institutions and I agree. In Chapter 1 the shift is described as the rise of a “nomadic” power structure; an elite that moves fluidly through global electronic and economic networks; making “conventional”, site-based political resistance increasingly ineffective and futile. Chapter 2 creates an addendum to the idea, The idea that the realm of virtual geography, arguing that because control now operates through digital and informational spaces, effective resistance must also move into these domains. CAE introduces the need for small, flexible, decentralized activist “cells” capable of performing electronic disturbance; symbolic, disruptive, or tactical interventions in networked systems designed to challenge or slow the flows of power that dominate contemporary life.</p>
    <h6><i>Hamlet on the Holodeck</i> By Janet Murray</h6>
    <p>Hamlet on the Holodeck was really interesting to me. I feel that the concept of digital media and computers being the devil and tied directly to the downfall of storytelling isn't so black and white. As someone who believes life actually exists in the shades of grey, I believe Murray did a great job of tapping into the very reasons I believe it can be another tool in story telling as opposed to its enemy. Just as with anything, too much can very quickly become disabling, but who is to say what is story telling and what isn't? Who is the almighty arbitrator of artistic structure and expression? The moment we police or place class on how you tell a story, the moment we lose the meaning of why we all create. Art shouldn't be elitist. This weeks reading was a meditation on how computers, games, virtual reality, and other digital media can transform the art of storytelling, and I enjoyed it immensely. </p>
    <h7><i></i>Lo and Behold Reveries of the Connected World</i></h7>
    <p> I loved having a doc as the material for the week! I do enjoy reading, but it was a fun mix up for the class! Moving forward: I found the documentary interesting. I found it so because it looks at the internet not just as a technology, but as a force that shapes what it means to be human. Werner Herzog doesn’t focus on statistics or technical explanations; instead, he explores the emotions, hopes, fears, and oddities that emerge from our relationship with connected devices. The film is fascinating because it moves from wonder to horror to humor, showing both the beauty of scientific achievement and the unsettling consequences of living in a hyperconnected world. By interviewing everyone from internet pioneers to grieving parents, from robotics experts to cybersecurity analysts, Herzog reveals how deeply the digital world is woven into our lives and how its future raises profound questions about identity, community, and humanity itself. </p>
    <h8><i> 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10</i></h8>
    <p>This week’s reading definitely caught my eye as far as the attention grabbing title! I am truly humbled by coding and all the complexities surrounding it. It's still challenging for me to wrap my head around at times, I am so grateful to have a bit of the basics under my belt! What  peaked my curiosity was how the book uses a single line of  basic code as a gateway into a big conversation about programming, design, randomness, creativity, and the cultural history of computing. It’s part critical study, part history, part aesthetic analysis which makes it so much  more than a simple technical explanation. Helped me get more into the code and find how to relates to greater conversations outside of that world! </p>
    <h9><i></i> Race After Technology</i> By Ruha Benjamin</h9>
      <p>Each week I find the course materials building on top of the other, bridging the gap between what we are doing in demos and what we can do and bring to our own projects! As a black woman, of course I must be fully transparent in saying I appreciate readings and moments in academia when the course material can relate to me or inform me personally on a  deeper level, as it inspires a more indepth interaction with the work and with our art. This book is about how racism can be built into technologies—even when those technologies appear “neutral,” scientific, or objective. It reminds me of the conversations we have had with others pertaining to how people train search engines and AI to generate things. Inherently biased. Maliciously so? Maybe not, but still hard to say. Benjamin argues that digital tools, algorithms, and automated systems regularly reinforce existing inequalities because they are created within a society that already has racial biases. She calls this the “New Jim Code,” (I MEAN HOW FUCKING BRILLIANT) meaning a plethora of discriminatory designs that hide behind claims of efficiency, innovation, or data-driven fairness. Race After Technology is especially interesting to me as a Black female artist because it shows how the systems shaping our digital world aren’t neutral. Colorblind anything doesn't exist. That alone opens powerful territory for creative critique, resistance, and reimagination. Ruha Benjamin exposes how algorithms, design choices, and everyday technologies can encode racial bias, but she also highlights the radical potential of those who challenge these systems. As an artist, I truly draw inspiration from her analysis to explore how race, identity, and technology intersect in both visible and invisible ways. The book invites one to question who gets represented, who gets erased, and who gets misread in technological spaces, questions that can deepen my artistic practice and give me new frameworks for creating work that disrupts bias, reclaims agency, and imagines more liberatory futures. </p>
    <h10><i>Glitch Feminism and Josh's Theory of Radicalization</i></h10>
<p>In the introduction, Russell explains that “glitch feminism” uses the digital realm as a space to challenge boundaries and escape the limitations placed on marginalized identities in the physical world. The glitch becomes a metaphor for breaking binaries: male/female, digital/physical, normal/abnormal, visible/invisible. She ties this to her own experiences and to broader histories of Black and queer resistance. The introduction sets the tone for the book’s larger argument: embracing the glitch; taking in instability, opacity, refusal, and fluidity which is (very much so)  a feminist and anti-racist strategy for imagining new ways of being. Josh’s Theory of Radicalization by Joshua Citarella is an analysis of how young people, especially those active in niche/unique online communities, move toward increasingly extreme political identities. As opposed to focusing on traditional pathways to radicalization (like organized extremist groups), Citarella looks at how internet culture, meme ecosystems, anonymity, and algorithmic feeds shape political identities in ways that are fluid, experimental, and often ironic. </p>
    
Joshua Citarella’s theory of radicalization and the introduction of Glitch Feminism by Legacy Russell come from very different worlds. One focuses on online political extremism, the other on digital feminist liberation. Although the blaring differences, they do happen to share some conceptual similarities that reveal how identity, technology, and digital spaces shape people today. Both focus on how identity is formed through digital environments, Both recognize that online spaces encourage fluid, shifting identities, Both emphasize the power of small, niche communities, and most importantly, Both critique the structures that shape digital identity.</p>
