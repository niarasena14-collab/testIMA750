    <h1>Fall 2025 Reading Reflections</h1>
    <h2><i>In Defense of the Poor Image</i> by Hito Steyerl, 2011</h2>
    <p>I loved this weeks’ reading on the poor image. As someone who has always considered themselves an underdog of sorts, I have always been quite intrigued by things that others may deem or categorize as invaluable or less than (as compared to other things). The idea of cropping, resizing, reformatting, redistributing, re re re, it’s a process of something being done over and over and over again, thus changing the quality of an image. Before this reading I hadn't seen how doing those things disturbs or lessens the quality (this is the very beginning of my coding and technical journey in film and art so they thought processes behind the way I view and approach art is transforming).. But I appreciate how the article made me question if  losing the sharpness of an image (the quality of the image) equates to losing the value of an image? I don’t think it does by any means, I do believe (particularly in my art of creating for wandering self seeking souls) it increases the value of it. The longevity of that image speaks volumes to its importance and value considerably so.  There is also something to be said about anything opaque and hard to make out, silhouettes of people or objects, struggling to make out what you are seeing, playing and pulling focus (as discussed in the article a s being identified as a class position) all such beautiful ways of describing life; Some things are easy to see and understand, others take time to come into view. </p>
    <h3><i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i> by Walter Benjamin</h3>
    <p>What I truly appreciate about the readings is that each week builds upon one another strengthening my understanding of the fundamentals of coding, photoshop, and how the mechanics behind both impact not only the art modes listed, but all art forms. I can honestly say my interest in art never really took me behind the veil of the art. I suppose the history of certain modes and how history and advancement in technology and civilization informed and influenced art.The adaptability of not only the art but the artists in and over time, redefining what that art was, and the accessibility or lack thereof to it. As tie went on, art became something outside of ritual and outside of being in service to that ritual. the ablitty for art tp become more than a religious expression or story telling became more prominent with time and the ability for art to be reporoduced. To be accessible to all. “An analysis of art in the age of mechanical reproduction must do justice to these relationships, for they lead us to an all-important insight: for the first time in world history, mechanical reproduction emancipates the work of art from its parasitical dependence on ritual.” The emancipation of art is such a poetic thing to say, it almost personifies art in a sense.  </p>
    <h3><i>As We May Think</i> by Vannevar Bush</h3>
    <p>This week’s reading was very informative! I must be honest, I never really had the deepest connection to machinery or science and how it relates to or aids in the creation of art. I think coding is really cool and a bit out of my understanding. I think the process of building from scratch is amazing and Bush. My interest (or for lack of a better term, door way) into art has always been more so through emotions and the relaying of those emotions. This class is absolutely redefining what and how I see art, how I can approach it not only from an emotional aspect but a technical one as well. I can’t say that this reading struck me deeply, but I would like to learn to appreciate the ways in which the mechanical, the technical, and the scientific can work in tandem to elevate my art. SECOND READ: I truly did enjoy my time reading this article the second time around. Certain aspects made more sense to me, or i was possibly simply in a better space mentally to fully appreciate the text. It made give thought to inventions and technology that aid in human advancement and necessity and gadgets that are created "because they're cool". The moral obligation we should have when creating and advancing in technology. </p>
    <h3><i>The Society of the Spectacle</i> by Guy Debord</h3>
    <p>This week's reading was great!!!! Although, I find myself frustrated with the cicular annd winding ways in which academia insitsts articles, passages, and matierals of the sort be discussed and written about, I do seem to find joy in finally cracking the code. Much how I felt readinng UNDER COMMONS by Moten annd Harney, Debord speaks in dense language about society and the ways in which illusiion creates falseness wreaking havoc on our interpersonnal relations as well as our idividuality.He diiscusses how we are ruled by consumer goods, rulled  by contennt creationn and appeariinng one way as opposed to really beiing iit. We went from crafttinng art to craftinng our lives in unrealistic surreall ways. He speaks about the ways in  which reality is distorted, erroded, and regergutated back out to us, and how we consume every morsel of it. The idea, or moreso, the reality of being/becoming a passive consumer and I couldn't help but think about how that effects art and the production of it. The demand for art has always been high regardlless the art form, and from previous readings we see how that has impacted the (over) reproduction of images of all kinds; things rarely seem to be one of a kind anymore. The link between commodity, individuality, repliciation, ACCESS (exclusivity) all of which are modes of the spectacle or used within the modes.Social media and Reality tv are BIG examples.</p>
