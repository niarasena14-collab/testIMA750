    <h1>Fall 2025 Reading Reflections</h1>
    <h2><i>In Defense of the Poor Image</i> by Hito Steyerl, 2011</h2>
    <p>I loved this weeks’ reading on the poor image. As someone who has always considered themselves an underdog of sorts, I have always been quite intrigued by things that others may deem or categorize as invaluable or less than (as compared to other things). The idea of cropping, resizing, reformatting, redistributing, re re re, it’s a process of something being done over and over and over again, thus changing the quality of an image. Before this reading I hadn't seen how doing those things disturbs or lessens the quality (this is the very beginning of my coding and technical journey in film and art so they thought processes behind the way I view and approach art is transforming).. But I appreciate how the article made me question if  losing the sharpness of an image (the quality of the image) equates to losing the value of an image? I don’t think it does by any means, I do believe (particularly in my art of creating for wandering self seeking souls) it increases the value of it. The longevity of that image speaks volumes to its importance and value considerably so.  There is also something to be said about anything opaque and hard to make out, silhouettes of people or objects, struggling to make out what you are seeing, playing and pulling focus (as discussed in the article a s being identified as a class position) all such beautiful ways of describing life; Some things are easy to see and understand, others take time to come into view. </p>
    <h3><i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</i> by Walter Benjamin</h3>
    <p>What I truly appreciate about the readings is that each week builds upon one another strengthening my understanding of the fundamentals of coding, photoshop, and how the mechanics behind both impact not only the art modes listed, but all art forms. I can honestly say my interest in art  never really took me behind the veil of the art. I suppose the history of certain modes and how history and advancement in technology and civilization informed and influenced art</p>
